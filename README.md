# Curve analysis

## Inspiration for this project

I created this project when I had curve analysis back in tenth grade. I wanted to check my solutions and often used websites which would solve my problems. Then I thought it would be nice to have my own program to check my solutions with.

I was quite experienced with Python and thought about creating a solution for myself. Also, my teacher did the same thing in Microsoft Excel, so it was sort of a competition.

### How to run the project

Direct to the directory, where the main script is scored. Then run the program using the `python main.py` command. Make sure you have tkinter installed on your computer.

Now, a window will be opened. You will see an entry field where you enter a function. After pressing *Generate solutions*, a Curve Discussion will be completed and outputted.
