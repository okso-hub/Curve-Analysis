# Curve analysis

## Inspiration for this project

I created this project when I had curve analysis back in tenth grade. My problem was that if I wanted to check my solutions, I always had to google a website and put in my function using bad syntax (e.g. 13x^2 - 4/3x^2).

I was quite experienced with Python and thought about creating a solution for myself. Also, my teacher did the same thing in Microsoft Excel, so it was sort of a competition.
